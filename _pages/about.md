Hi! Iâ€™m a junior undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, pursuing a BS in Public Health with a Nutrition concentration at the Gillings School of Global Public Health, a second BS in Quantitative Biology, and a minor in Data Science. 

I am driven by the goal of creating innovative public health and clinical solutions to combat chronic diseases that undermine health and wellbeing worldwide. Drawing on my background in public health, quantiative biology, and data science, I integrate diverse methodologies to uncover the complex interactions between biological and socioeconomic factors that contribute to chronic disease risk. 

## skills

- Statistical computing in R and Python with *tidyverse* and *pandas*
- Modeling with linear/logistic regression and ANOVA
- Machine learning classificaition/regression with KNN, SVM, decision trees, and random forest
- Explainable machine learning
- Data visualization in *ggplot2*
- Epidemiologic study design (cohort, case/control, cross-sectional) and data analysis
- Clinical trial study design and data analysis
- Metabolic analysis and visualization with *py3dmol* and *escher*
- Bench lab skills (ImmunoCAP, ELISA, PCR, cell culturing)
- Community-engaged public health practice

## research

- Under the guidance of Drs. [Mike Kulis](https://www.med.unc.edu/pediatrics/foodallergy/lab/kulis-lab/) and [Edwin Kim](https://www.med.unc.edu/pediatrics/people/edwin-kim-md-ms/) (UNC), I have completed a first-author manuscript exploring mechanisms and biomarkers associated with patient success on peanut sublingual immunotherapy. The manuscript is currently under review by the *Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology*, with an abstract accepted for presentation at the *American Association of Allergy and Immunology 2025 Annual Meeting*.

- Under the mentorship of [Dr. Corrine Keet](https://www.med.unc.edu/pediatrics/people/corinne-keet-md-phd/) (UNC), I am developing a machine learning methedology to identify neighborhood-specific risk and protective factors linked to asthma occurrence and exacerbation using restricted NHIS, Census, and HUD data.

- Working with [Dr. Monique Bethell](https://www.capitalareafoodnetwork.org/leadership) (Capital Area Food Network), I co-authored a community-engaged analysis of trends in Indigenous food soverignty. Dr. Bethell presented our findings were presented at the *American Public Health Association 2024 Annual Meeting*. 

## teaching

- Currently, I am teaching a graded, for-credit seminar course titled *Culinary Medicine: A Tool for Health Equity, Disease Prevention, and Disease Management* to fifteen undergraduate students. I developed this course from scratch under the guidance of [Dr. Alice Ammerman](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/alice-ammerman-drph/). The syllabus and course materials can be found in the [projects tab](http://neel-i-singh.github.io/projects/). 

- I have served as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for [Dr. Matthew Lockett's](https://chem.unc.edu/faculty/Lockett-Matthew/) Analytical Chemistry course for three semesters, and [Dr. Eric Hastie's](https://bio.unc.edu/faculty-profile/hastie/) Biological Research Skills lab for one semester. 

## clinical

- I serve as a CNA in the Emergency Department at UNC Medical Center in Chapel Hill, NC. My work involves managing high-stress and high-acuity emergency situations, including triaging patients, monitoring vital signs, collecting specimens, performing EKGs, and other emergency nursing care.
